## Project Description

Our aim is to build a tightly-bound ecosystem of software tools to help people set nutrition goals, gain insight to their nutrient intake, and get customized suggestions for new foods or ingredients to add to their diet based on their unique dietary restrictions. This project will involve building a combined database from many nutrient datasets, as well as developing a custom API to query foods and generate suggestions. We will also develop at least one front-end application to interact with this database and API, such as a mobile app or web app. Upon completion of our project, users will be able to intuitively navigate through a very large dataset of micronutrient profiles, get a simple visual summary of progress towards their goals, and gain access to well-informed food recommendations that do not exist on any free nutrient apps today.
