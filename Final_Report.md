### Project Abstract
Our aim is to build a tightly-bound ecosystem of software tools to help people set nutrition goals, gain insight to their nutrient intake, and get customized suggestions for new foods or ingredients to add to their diet based on their unique dietary restrictions.  This project will involve building a combined database from many nutrient datasets, as well as developing a custom API to query foods and generate suggestions. We will also develop at least one front-end application to interact with this database and API, such as a mobile app or web app. Upon completion of our project, users will be able to intuitively navigate through a very large dataset of micronutrient profiles, get a simple visual summary of progress towards their goals, and gain access to well-informed food recommendations that do not exist on any free nutrient apps today.

## Project Description

## User Stories and Design Diagrams
### User Stories:
- As a person with dietary constraints (vegan or vegetarian), I want to find a good replacement for particular foods that meet my nutrient goals.
- As a student, I want to find easy ways to incorporate more nutrients into my diet.
- As an athlete, I want to track my macronutrient intake in order to help maintain my muscle mass.

## Self-Assessment Essays
Sarah:

Senior Design in a way represents the culmination of years of hard work and determination. Now, during our final year of college, our team will utilize skills and knowledge that we have acquired over these past five years. This project is an opportunity to not only showcase professional and academic growth, but work on something in an area of interest. Having completed all of my co-op rotations in the area of mobile app development, creating a web application has constantly been an interest of mine and an area I seek to grow in technically. My team’s senior design project fosters an environment in which web development skills can be learned and applied. Additionally, working on a web development project will allow me to explore its similarities and differences with mobile development, and if/how the two interact. Our project will be specifically focused in the area of health and nutrition and provide users an easy way to view, understand, and track their various nutrition levels. Additional features, such as allowing users to view how certain food and/or diets affect one’s mental and emotional health, will also be incorporated. I am eager to gain a better understanding of the tools and technologies used in web development, while also being able to further grow existing technical and non-technical skills. 

My academic curriculum has provided me with knowledge of various project management and programming concepts and tools that will be vital to our team’s success and collaboration. Programming concepts learned during CS 2028C: Data Structures will become very beneficial when coding certain components of our project. Data Structures taught us how to distinguish between the different types of data structures and know when to implement them into your project. Similarly, CS 4071: Design and Analysis of Algorithms provided a foundational understanding of various computing algorithms, which will become a necessary implementation in our project as we will need to parse through nutritional data. In terms of the project management side of the project, EECE3093C: Software Engineering will help guide us in scheduling and planning various items in our project. Different organizational diagrams learned from the class will aid our team when determining the functionality of features and how certain workflows should behave. Overall, the various courses I have taken over the past five years of my college experience have helped to lay a firm foundation for my team’s upcoming senior design project. 

During my co-op experience at two different companies, I gained valuable skills and knowledge that will translate into designing and creating our team's senior design project. First, I worked at Atomic Robot as an App Developer Co-op. While working for Atomic Robot, I got experience in developing iOS apps and creating mobile apps for both iOS and Android using a framework called Flutter. Not only did I learn what the app development process looks like, but I gained real-world experience with agile project management, working within a sprint format, and the overall mindset needed when working on an application that relies heavily on user interaction. In addition, I grew in my communication skills as meetings were often conducted with stakeholders present. The success of the project was largely determined by ensuring the stakeholders' needs and desires are fulfilled. My last two co-op rotations were spent working as a Software Developer at London Computer Systems on their mobile team. While at LCS, I worked on various bug fixes and small feature additions to the Android version of the rmAppSuitePro app. This experience allowed me to develop technical skills in an area I was not familiar with prior, but also gave me the opportunity to practice and strengthen existing skills. Communication and collaboration with my team members was essential to the completion of the tickets that were assigned to me as the framework and architecture of the app was rather complex. While web development and app development are not necessarily the same thing, there are many similarities between the two. I plan to utilize my app development experience in completing various tasks in the development of our web-based senior design project. My experience of working closely with others on a team will help me effectively collaborate with my classmates and contribute to the success of our senior design project. 

I am particularly excited to work on our decided senior design project because of my own interests in the nutrition/healthcare space and my experience with mobile app development. Creating and developing an application in the healthcare space can not only be technically challenging, but can be widely beneficial to its users. The presence of web and mobile applications in today’s software industry has given rise to many web-based medical applications for users, hospitals, and healthcare companies. Having experienced my own struggles with diet and nutrition, I understand the importance of having an easy to use and understandable resource for managing your own personal health needs. While various nutrition applications exist, there are gaps that exist within this space. My preliminary approach would be to research the various types of nutritional applications that exist, and see where there is a need. Such areas could include tracking mental health and learning how one’s diet can affect their mood, understanding flavor profiles and their associated nutrition values, and more. Once a focus is determined, I would then start drafting out what the purpose of the application is, what proprietary features are needed, and how that can be achieved. As soon as foundational aspects of the project are defined, the drafting, design, and development process can begin.
In terms of measuring personal growth and success over the course of the year, I hope to be able to recognize a tangible difference in both my technical and non-technical skills. While I do not anticipate being able to build all of the ideas our team comes up with, I do expect for us to complete the basic functionality of our project and the features we deem the most important. In addition, a high level of quality should be seen in our work, displaying not only our technical skill set but our care and determination when completing tasks. Measuring one's level of contribution to a project can be difficult depending on the complexity of tasks to be completed. For the tasks I am able to complete, I will consider them a success if they are developed in a timely manner but also with careful execution. In the event that I am unable to finish a task because of its challenging nature or semester deadlines, any reasonable progress I have made in development and research on a task can be considered a success. Once our team outlines a set of features that we are certain we want to implement, theoretically, our project can be said to be done once those are finished. Realistically, revision often happens in the development process, so our team may also be considered done if all necessary features are implemented but additional “nice to have“ features or not. At the conclusion of my senior design experience, I hope to be able to look back on not only my individual work, but my team's efforts and see the hard work and dedication we put into our project in the various ways we were able to grow both technically and non-technically.

The senior design project is a culmination of all our skills put to use in order to make a cohesive product. This will be a useful experience that bridges the gap between the theory of the classroom and the practical skills learned on co-op. Often in the classroom, we are learning the principles of the underlying technologies that we use today but never make an actual full product. On co-op, we often learn how to use the understanding from the classroom to develop an actual product, but often times are building on a product that already exists or has been thought up by the company. It will be unique to work on a product from idea conception all the way through to making a finished product and having to make design decisions every step of the way without anything being decided for us. This will surely come with some errors but will provide valuable experience by going through each step of the development process from scratch in making a real product.

The college curriculum will provide useful experience for the project’s development. I think the most directly useful course might be EECE3093C Software Engineering because it teaches about a project’s development cycle and how to effectively create a roadmap for the project to keep a project on course. Another course, CS4092 Database Design and Development could prove to be useful when deciding what the most effective way would be to store our data and how to successfully work with that data. CS2028C Data Structures could be useful, even though most of the data structures we learned to create are widely available to be used, it’s helpful to know which data structure to use in which situation in order to more efficiently interact with data. Although not likely to make it into the final version of our web app due to time constraints, CS5173 Deep Learning may come into use if we decide to implement a recommendation system or for analyzing data as a potential product feature. A class like ENGL4092 Technical and Scientific Writing would be useful for writing proper documentation and the design documents for the project.

I did five rotations at London Computer Systems which is a company that makes rent management software. My first co-op, I was in QA and created and executed test plans. This will be useful as we get into the later stages of our project to create an organized way to make sure our project is working as expected. The rest of my rotations were working as a full stack web developer using an angular frontend and .NET backend. This experience will be directly relevant since we will be making a web app. While we will most likely not use the technologies that I have direct experience in, I’ve worked with other similar technologies, and they are similar enough to where the skills will transfer over to whatever we end up choosing. Also, the skills of working on a team on a large product with a large codebase is a valuable skill that will transfer over from co-op.

For our project, we are planning to create a web and potentially mobile based app in the nutrition/health space. We do not have a final decision on the full direction we want to take it yet but have several potential more specific project ideas in the nutrition/health space we can explore. One project we are exploring is tracking mental health alongside nutritional intake to recognize correlations between the two to understand what foods/ingredients affect how you feel. Another potential project would be trying to create a flavor profile for someone and giving specific recipe recommendations based on the profile. This area of technology is exciting and motivating to work on as it can be something I use myself to improve my own life as nutrition/health pertains to everyone. I am motivated to create a real-world project that provides value even if it does not necessarily reach many people.

Once we decide on a clearer direction from the project, we will nail down the key features that we want to implement. After we find exactly what we think we need, we can add some additional features that would be nice to add if time permits. We can then make a timeline where we would ideally have each of the features implemented and assigning roles in the team that gives everyone a clear task to complete. We will have to make decisions on what technologies we want to use and how we want the product to look like before development would begin. After all this planning is complete, actual development of the project can begin. As far as evaluating levels of contribution, the roles will be decided as a team to give everyone an equal workload and as long as each member completes their role to the design specification we all decide on before development, then a full contribution was made. If we make a thorough enough design plan at the beginning, there shouldn’t be a question whether something is done or not. Revisions could be made along the way as necessary as long as they don’t stray away too far from the initially design since we have a constrained time limit to complete the project.

My team’s senior design project is all about putting everything I have learned from my previous classes together and test my knowledge and expertise. Essentially, the project’s goal is to be able to build a functional, useful, and reliable piece of software. The software we are planning to build is a health-based app. Specifically, we are hoping to develop an application that analyzes nutrition content in a variety of foods and potentially help users track and achieve their fitness/dietary goals. Personally, I see this project to be my defining opportunity to put all my skills in practice and produce something fruitful out of it. Prior work experience during co-ops has a significant impact on the development of this project’s idea and planning in terms of determining technical requirements, scale, and scope of the project.

The college curriculum has provided me with a breadth of experience and knowledge with the kinds of courses that were offered. Specifically, EECE3093C – Software Engineering has broadened my understanding of the software development planning, documentation, scope, and scheduling. CS2028C – Data Structures has introduced me to the inner workings of basic structures that we use everyday while also increasing my understanding of building functions, objects, and files that can be reused efficiently. CS4092 – Database Design/Development has provided me with an in-depth understanding of data storage, database modeling, and design. All this knowledge will aid the development of our project to be more technically robust and help achieve the reliability standards that we are aiming for. All in all, the knowledge I have gained from other courses such as Technical Writing, Python Programming, etc. will also assist me in ensuring that the project goes through a smooth development process while also meeting our expectations.

The five co-op experiences have completely changed my perspective of software development and its inner workings. For the most of them, I have worked at the same firm - Fox Corporation. Initially, I have worked as a full-stack developer and essentially improved all my technical abilities. Specifically, I have worked with API development, database management, deployment tools, etc. In the later rotations, I have taken up the role of a Machine Learning intern. During my time as a Machine Learning intern, I have furthered my understanding of API development pertaining to Machine Learning features. Primarily, I have leveraged AWS tools and Machine Learning specific platforms to build, test, and deploy Machine Learning functions. The culmination of all the co-op experiences will guide me in the development of this project by helping me to better work with my team members.

My primary motivation for this project is that I believe that this project will make a difference in the real world by solving real problems. A health-based application that can provide its users with working solutions has been a personal area of interest for me for a long time. As someone who likes to maintain a healthy daily routine in terms of food consumption, I can imagine the positive impact that this application could potentially have on its users. With a plethora of unreliable healthcare apps available in the market, I feel it is of high importance to make an application available to everyone that is both specific and reliable by its nature. At this point, my preliminary approach would be to layout fundamental aspects of the project by determining scale, scope, and design direction. Subsequently, carrying out research to determine what the existing healthcare apps do and what is actually necessary to be done. Once that is set in stone, I would proceed with the development of the application.

As for the expected results, I personally need the application to be minimalistic while still adding value to its existence. Primarily, I would want the application to be functional, mostly bug-free, and reliable. I understand that bugs are inevitable in a software’s life cycle and do not expect our project to be completely big-free. Once the software development process reaches a stage where it does not break very often and is considerably reliable on a day-to-day basis, I would see that as an accomplishment. For self-evaluation, I am considering maintaining a journal that keeps a track of my progress and helps me make sure I deliver my responsibilities. By the end of the development process, I would then crosscheck with my initial goals for the role I pick to ensure that I have met the expectations. That way, I can determine if I have done a good job.

Our senior design project is described here in this paragraph. We are making a nutrition tracking application. There are things that we are doing differently than pre-existing applications. Firstly, we do not just track nutri-profile (micro and macro). We also track flavor profiles. Apart from flavor, which includes olfactory preferences, we can also personalize recommendations. 

 

There are numerous ways where COOP experiences would come in handy in this project. First and foremost, engineering skills. Secondly, development experience. And lastly, data analysis skills. I have done similar things with modeling for application at my last internship with equities price modeling for trade directions. Considering all the above, we should be able to draw upon our skills here to make something good.

 

In terms of the CS curriculum- the most helpful classes here are described sentence-wise. Why sentence-wise? Because we, in this assignment, have a minimum sentence numbering to follow rather than a natural content focus. Interesting!

Intro to programming: A good foundation
Operating Systems: A magnificent thinking structure for multi-programming
Intelligent Data Analysis: Absolute gold skill for our purpose here
Applied Mathematical Modelling: Builds up on the IDA but is equally important, especially since we plan to make this high efficacy in personalization.
Parallel Computing: Builds up on OS class but efficient engineering skills for our application design.
 

The last two paragraphs will discuss motivation and the expected feature set.

 

Motivation:

There are many products such as ours in the market, but most of them are good at / just one (possibly multiple, but not all) things below:

Tracking Macro
Tracking Micro
Tracking Calories
Personalized nutrition recommendation
Flavor/preference tracking
Personalizing preference recommendations
Carryover nutrition details
Fasting recommendations
Activity tracking
 

Expected Results:

Combining all these feature sets into one product will be challenging, considering the Model part for predictive/personalizing activities and data points will require deep research and analysis. Regardless we plan to be able to pull it off with the resources at our disposal. Upon successful implementation, users will not just b able to stop purchasing multiple subscriptions for similar things but be able to get all from an open source project for free and will be able to lead a healthier lifestyle with way less effort.
