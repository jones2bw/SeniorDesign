# Rajdeep Final Self Assessment

During the development of our senior design project, my contribution primarily revolved around the research and implementation of the statistical models that were used to generate personalized food recommendations. I applied and built upon the skills identified in my initial assessment from last Fall by incorporating machine learning techniques, data analysis, and mathematical modeling. To accomplish this, I conducted extensive research on various algorithms and models, eventually selecting and fine-tuning a suitable model to cater to the unique dietary requirements of each user. Throughout the project, I learned a great deal about data pre-processing, feature engineering, and model optimization. I also built competencies in programming, project management, and collaboration.

My most significant success was the successful integration of the model and backend with the app interface, which allowed for seamless user interaction and precise recommendations. However, I faced obstacles in ensuring that the model could adapt to the diverse dietary preferences and restrictions of different users, which required some thought. Despite these challenges, I managed to overcome them by seeking advice from peers, conducting further research, and collaborating with my team members.
