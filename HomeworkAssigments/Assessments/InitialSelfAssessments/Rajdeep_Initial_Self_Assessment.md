# Rajdeep Initial Self Assessment

Our senior design project is described here in this paragraph. We are making a nutrition tracking application. There are things that we are doing differently than pre-existing applications. Firstly, we do not just track nutri-profile (micro and macro). We also track flavor profiles. Apart from flavor, which includes olfactory preferences, we can also personalize recommendations.

There are numerous ways where COOP experiences would come in handy in this project. First and foremost, engineering skills. Secondly, development experience. And lastly, data analysis skills. I have done similar things with modeling for application at my last internship with equities price modeling for trade directions. Considering all the above, we should be able to draw upon our skills here to make something good.

In terms of the CS curriculum- the most helpful classes here are described sentence-wise. Why sentence-wise? Because we, in this assignment, have a minimum sentence numbering to follow rather than a natural content focus. Interesting!

Intro to programming: A good foundation
Operating Systems: A magnificent thinking structure for multi-programming
Intelligent Data Analysis: Absolute gold skill for our purpose here
Applied Mathematical Modelling: Builds up on the IDA but is equally important, especially since we plan to make this high efficacy in personalization.
Parallel Computing: Builds up on OS class but efficient engineering skills for our application design.

The last two paragraphs will discuss motivation and the expected feature set.

Motivation:

There are many products such as ours in the market, but most of them are good at / just one (possibly multiple, but not all) things below:

Tracking Macro
Tracking Micro
Tracking Calories
Personalized nutrition recommendation
Flavor/preference tracking
Personalizing preference recommendations
Carryover nutrition details
Fasting recommendations
Activity tracking

Expected Results:

Combining all these feature sets into one product will be challenging, considering the Model part for predictive/personalizing activities and data points will require deep research and analysis. Regardless we plan to be able to pull it off with the resources at our disposal. Upon successful implementation, users will not just b able to stop purchasing multiple subscriptions for similar things but be able to get all from an open source project for free and will be able to lead a healthier lifestyle with way less effort.
