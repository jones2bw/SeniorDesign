## Project sought
My scope is interest is fairly wide for a senior design project: I'd definitely like to do something involving data analytics and/or an interactive web app. I'm particularly interested in civic tech (i.e. working with government datasets or online utilities), as well as education tools: for example, an app for learning about different species of plants.
