# Professional Biography
I am Raj, I am a senior year student and have had 4 coops at Infinera ( a telecom B2B that specializes in bandwidth and latency-sensitive network products) where I worked as a firmware engineer coop in the product-development team. My last coop was a bit different- it was with a boutique proprietary trading firm where I worked as a research engineer.

All my coops were in the realm of C++ performance-sensitive projects with a tad bit more data analysis, stats, and ML for the last one with a lot more low-latency engineering.
